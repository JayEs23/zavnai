          ZAVN blends behavioral science, coaching psychology, and conversational
          AI to help you close the gap between intention and action. This is a
          high-level primer you can refine later with your own research layer.

            Echo sessions externalize your thinking so cognitive distortions and
            hidden assumptions become visible. Doyn turns those clarified
            intentions into concrete, low-friction next actions. Thrive guards
            energy and capacity so execution is sustainable. Tribe connects that
            progress with the people who matter, creating healthy accountability
            loops.

            Under the hood, this looks like stateful conversations, goal
            formation, implementation intentions, and ongoing feedback loops—
            orchestrated by agents that remember where you are in the process.
